PiAM

This is based off of the original [pihat](http://www.skagmo.com/page.php?p=projects/22_pihat) project, which turned the 'Pi into an ASK / PAM transceiver for home automation.

This project is comprised of the "radio" C files which wrap timing-critical application logic in a manner suitable for Python use.

"test.py" uses the exposed functions to transmit "hello world" via ASK (or FSK, currently dysfunctional) with a symbol width of 100000uS.
